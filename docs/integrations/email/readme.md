# Email Integrations

We aim to provide a common interface to support as many of the most popular email integrations as possible.
This means that we need to be able to support as many of the common features as possible.

To be supported the email integration provider needs to support the following features:

- emails with text and html bodies
- emails with attachments
- emails with template support
- email event tracking
- schedule delivery

Possible features
- message queueing

Currently, the following integrations are being looked at to be supported:
- Mailgun
- Sendgrid
